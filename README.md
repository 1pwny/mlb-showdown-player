MLB Showdown was a card game released by Wizards of the Coast from 2000-2005.

The game combines the appeal of stats-based Baseball cards with a type of strategy/teambuilding aspect
that would be familiar to people that play Fantasy sports.

The game is also remarkably simple - all that anyone needs to play are 9 fielders, a few pitchers, and
a single twenty-sided die.

Because of this, it was popular at some playgrounds and summer camps - or well, those are the only
places I played it. It's nostalgic, but I don't think it's an incredibly compelling game.

However, the limited print run and relatively simple rules lends this game to _far_ greater level
of automation than I would expect from most TCGs. In fact, determining the mathematically best
players and strategies feels positively attainable.

This repository is to help me fulfill my childhood wish of having the 'best' lineup. While I have
it mostly narrowed down, there are some places where the choice between the top few players isn't
clear.

This isn't coded in Python because it's a very object-oriented project, and Python simply isn't
the optimal programming language for object-oriented tasks.
